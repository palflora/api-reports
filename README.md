# API-reports
These are example scripts that access Calflora's API to create customized reports of a Weed Manager group's data. You can copy these and adapt them to meet your own group's needs. 

Note that different groups use different forms with different fields, so fields used in these scripts may not be available in your group. To explore the fields used in your group see the API Documentation.
